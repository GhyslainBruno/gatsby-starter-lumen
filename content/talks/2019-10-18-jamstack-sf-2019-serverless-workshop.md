## About

Join Netlifyâ€™s David Wells as he leads attendees through building a production-ready, full-stack application with serverless functions, a NoSQL datastore, and React.

Building with serverless functions requires some thinking about how to approach the design and development of your applications, and an understanding of the tooling available.

This workshop will teach you how to get started with serverless functions, including how to use Netlify Functions. You'll gain an understanding of some of the underlying principles of serverless architectures as we build our own serverless application.
