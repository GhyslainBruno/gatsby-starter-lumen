[Deploy codesandbox projects into Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2019/03/26/deploy-codesandbox-to-netlify/).

This was an integration project with the wonderful folks over at [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io ).

We wanted to add a way for codesandbox users to be able to one-click deploy from their CodeSandbox project.

The integration deploys an anonymous Netlify site that is later claimed by the user into their own Netlify account.

Deploy via your sandbox!

Claim your site after it deploys.
