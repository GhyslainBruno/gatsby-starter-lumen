Onboarding wizard for new [serverless.com](https://serverless.com) users.

This React app was the onboarding flow in serverless.com and inside the product.

The app itself was built to be used as embeddable third party JavaScript. This means it can be included on any page without altering the hosting app/site. This architecture made it **much** easier to alter/edit without blocking dependencies or waiting for full application deployments.

**Features:**

- Embeddable anywhere
- Saves the user's progress as they step through wizard
- Support any number of steps/content
