Sometimes I'm not sure where I'm going.

I know I'm moving, and there are tracks behind me. Perhaps this is what is essential, those tracks.

The hardest part of doing something is starting.

Once in motion, you start working towards a flow. Once you are in flow, it's easy to make progress. (aka in the zone)

Keeping that lucid state on track towards an ambiguous destination, now that's a challenge.

As long as I'm moving, there is a sense of purpose. Perhaps that **is** the destination?

Eventually, you will reach your destination or realize there isn't one. The journey was the destination all along. Imagine that.

One thing is for sure though: I'm not sure **where** I'm going but **I'm going**.
