It would seem that a mountain of opportunity exists in industries and situations where creativity seems vacant.

Banksy created art out of normal everyday street objects.

Walt Disney created a magical wonderland out of a swamp.

Steve Jobs created a user-friendly music player in a world where more buttons/features used to win.

Every day people are finding stagnant situations and rewriting the rules.

The next "problem" you encounter ask yourself if I had the power to change this, what would I do differently to improve the experience?

Now remove **if** from that statement and **do it.**
