You can scour the Internet and find a never-ending supply of marketing tips and advice to implement on top of your current marketing strategies.

_Whoopty freakin' do..._

The overwhelming majority of the advice is focused on tactics around optimizing tiny bits of your overall marketing strategies.

Tactics are cool but rarely do folks go back to the **fundamentals** of marketing.

All the noise on the Internet tends to lead marketers down the never-ending rabbit hole of micro-optimizations. These micro-optimizations tend to be very tedious things to implement with a very minimal return.

Do you want more bang for your buck?

**Here is the one thing you need to remember, the one immutable truth in online marketing:**

> **The easier it is for someone to complete a task on your site, the more likely they are to complete that task.**

A.k.a. **Make things easy & kill friction wherever it exists.**

The effort you were going to waste in that "awesome" Instagram campaign should be put to better use by walking through your site and identifying unnecessary points of friction.

## Identify and Kill Friction

**Ask yourself these questions to identify points of friction:**

*   Have you been through your website recently? Do you have multiple conversion points setup talking to prospects at ALL stages of the buying cycle?
*   How does your cart checkout process look? Are they extra form fields or clicks that the user must take to finally hit that buy button?
*   Is your site easy to read? Is it easy to navigate? How do you know? Test it.
*   Can people reach you with having to pick up a phone and dial your number?
*   Are you documenting frequently asked questions?
*   Do your landing pages forms ask for too much information?
*   Can people one-click follow you on a variety of social platforms?
*   Do your highly-trafficked pages have relevant calls to action on them?

There are many other things to consider, and they will be pretty specific on a per-website basis.

Use common sense. **Really** think about antiquated, slow, and sucky things about your current website and fix them.

Put yourself in the shoes of a person who has little time to learn every nook and cranny of your site and wants something NOW. Then give them what they want.

Making everything on your site **as easy as possible** to do will get more people completing those actions. It's simple.
