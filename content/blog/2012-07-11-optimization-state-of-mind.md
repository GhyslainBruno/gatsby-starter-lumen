## <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Show Notes</span>

The consumer buying cycle is not a one-way path.

The idea that shoppers only use google to find and buy products is one-sided.  Social media plays an increasingly bigger piece as time goes on.

## Developing a Customer Persona

Egocentric content works only to an extent. People don't want to share and consume your website pages about blue and green widgets.

What journey does the customer take in the process of researching your products and deeper into the purchasing process.

## How to gain insights?

Hire an inbound agency :)

Bring in your current customers into a social media aggregation service to cross-reference what sites they are active on, and dive in from there.

Have a **characterization of who your best customers are** and **also who your worst customers are.**

Developing personas is an ongoing process that requires re-visitation and refinement over time. Optimization if you will.

## Top Rank's Content Strategy

Lee has a fixed content plan that is flexible for wildcats posts.

"Educating them through their journey"

## How to compensate for SSL keywords  issues

1.  Have a keyword map of all of the keywords you want to focus on with your content.
2.  Use historical data and look for patterns.
3.  Clustering pages together based off of your keyword map and look at the traffic levels going to each page.
4.  Look in google webmaster tools to see those keywords to see what the impressions look like.
