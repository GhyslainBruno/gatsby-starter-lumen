ðŸ‘‹ **Hi, I'm David.**

I like building fun things with serverless tech.

Most of my time is spent on software architecture, user experience, and product development.

I'm currently working with [Netlify](http://netlify.com), as a technical product manager, where I help bring to life new software to help developers streamline their workflows & build more awesome.

Before Netlify, I was hustling as a full stack developer & dev advocate at [Serverless Inc.](http://serverless.com). Before that, I was the lead developer on the UI/UX team at [Mulesoft](http://www.mulesoft.com), building their design system.

Long ago, in a galaxy far far away, I ran a company called [Inbound Now](http://www.inboundnow.com), where we built a variety of open-source marketing tools to help companies to grow their businesses.

Before writing a line of code, I was a marketing consultant at [HubSpot](http://www.hubspot.com), where I helped hundreds of companies with their content strategy, conversion rate optimization, and inbound lead generation.
